CMake is cross-platform free and open-source software for build automation, testing, packaging and installation of software by using a compiler-independent method. CMake basically helps to compile the source files and link the libraries.

If the CMakeLists.txt files are ready, just make a build directory, and build as shown below.

```console
$ mkdir build-dir
$ cd build-dir
$ cmake ../
$ cmake --build .
```

Then you will get an executable file.
